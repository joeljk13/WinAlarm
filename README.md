WinAlarm
========

An alarm clock for Windows. It's technically written in C++, but it has what feels like an awkward mix of C and C++ style. The source code isn't a complete mess, though.

Features
========

* Sound effects
* Flashes a solid color on the screen
* Wakes the computer up for the alarm, so it can be left in sleep or hibernate overnight
* No limit to the number of alarms set
* Can set different levels for each alarm (normal, warning, critical)
* Requires a number to be entered correctly to turn off alarm, preventing turning off the alarm from being too easy

Use alarm.exe --help to get the entire list of features. For each command, you can do alarm.exe COMMAND --help to get the options for that command.
